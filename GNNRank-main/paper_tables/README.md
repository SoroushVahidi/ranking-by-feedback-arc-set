# Manuscript tables (CSV + LaTeX)

Generated by `python tools/build_paper_tables.py` from the leaderboard CSVs under `paper_csv/`.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| table1_main_leaderboard.csv / .tex | Per-method leaderboard summary: median/mean upset_simple, upset_ratio, upset_naive; coverage. Sorted by median upset_simple ascending. |
| table2_compute_matched.csv / .tex | Same metrics, restricted to runs with runtime_sec ≤ 1800 s. |
| table2_coverage.csv | Per-method counts: n_valid_upset_simple, n_valid_runtime, n_timeout, n_within_time_budget. |
| table3_missingness_audit.csv / .tex | Per-method: valid_metrics, valid_runtime, timeouts, finance_like_exclusions. |
| table3_missingness_audit_by_family.csv / .tex | Same quantities aggregated by method family (OURS, classical, GNN, other). |

## LaTeX

The `.tex` files use `\toprule`, `\midrule`, `\bottomrule`. Add to your preamble:

```latex
\usepackage{booktabs}
```

Use the tabulars inside a `table` (or `longtable`) environment and add `\caption{...}` and `\label{...}` as in the comments at the bottom of each file.
